## About us
Broken Circles is a data visualisation and consumer empowerment tool that takes data on the true and hidden costs of materials, manufacture, usage, and end of life costs, to make more fully informed choices possible. We embrace the ideas of The [Circular Economy](https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/explore/the-circular-economy-in-detail) to achieve this. We are empowering citizens to make better choices for themselves and the planet, linking to social, well-being and health as well as environmental factors. 

## About the Call
We are keen to include diverse voices and different perspectives on this topic. In January we will open two micro art residencies, inviting artists to take over a social media account and use words, images, photography, moving image, physical works, anything really, to explore the themes of the project, citizen motivations and behaviours.
We are open to challenging, curious, uncomfortable, complex, novel ways of using a limited medium to create a conversation, reach followers.

Watch this space, and we will announce more details and how to get involved on 7th January 2021.
Announcements will be made on instagram [@bemorecircular](https://www.instagram.com/bemorecircular/)
