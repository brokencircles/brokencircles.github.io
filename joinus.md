## About us
Broken Circles is a data visualisation and consumer empowerment tool that takes data on the true and hidden costs of materials, manufacture, usage, and end of life costs, to make more fully informed choices possible. We embrace the ideas of The [Circular Economy](https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/explore/the-circular-economy-in-detail) to achieve this. We are empowering citizens to make better choices for themselves and the planet, linking to social, well-being and health as well as environmental factors. 

Dave (a creative technologist based in Bath) and Jon (a UX designer based in Cornwall), and their network of expert advisors, have come together to create a prototype, but we need some extra help.

# The Role
As an intern, you will support us in our prototype research and development, to inform, empower, and motivate citizens in a move towards a circular economy.
The work will be varied, but centrally we need help to find, assess and process environmental information about materials, use and energy and waste data for use in our model.
We will also need help with the broader project, helping us plan, run and process the outcomes from workshops with people across the region.
We will welcome fresh ideas on the design and effectiveness of the prototype.
Help with communication, blogging and social media will also be needed.

As an intern, we do not expect candidates to come with lots of work experience, but we want you to demonstrate your passion for environmental and sustainability issues, ability to work with common technology (like Google docs, spreadsheets and presentations), and be able to reach out to people in a friendly way.
