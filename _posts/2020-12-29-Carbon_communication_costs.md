# Carbon Communication Costs

Collaborating on an art project during the Covid lockdowns had brought new challenges and ways of using technology. We are spread across the South West and so have been communicating a lot remotely. 

Using some very high-level rough figures sourced primarily from Gerry McGovern's Wild Wide Waste talk at Green Tech Bristol, we became very aware that our digital project has an environmental cost attached to it.

Later, online research revealed a rough estimate of 29G of carbon for each data postcard sent.

Our project has to be environmentally worthwhile to mitigate these costs and we need to consider new ways of working.
