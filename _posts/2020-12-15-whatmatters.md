# Getting to What Matters

We have  advertised a pilot workshop on citizen perspectives for our project, running this week. We did this to put pressure on ourselves to establish and test the format, intent, and goals for our workshop before everything rests for a Christmas break.

The pressure has worked, in that it focussed my mind and helped take nebulous ideas of what we might do, and crystallise them into something that suits a workshop. We need there to be structure, so people know what is expected of them, but also it cannot be prescriptive. We want open ended prompts to provoke exploratory engagement from our workshoppers. We are after stories, reactions, feelings. this is the data we seek. As Jon pointed out, there are already plenty of studies on consumer behaviours in the psychology and marketing worlds for us to draw on. We want something altogether more human, anecdotal, that we can use to pitch our stories and visualisations at the reasons people do or do not act in certain ways. This is wahat matters. Grounding our work, not in our own assumptions, but the real views and stories of people in the South West.
