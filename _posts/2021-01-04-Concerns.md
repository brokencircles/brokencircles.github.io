# What Concerns Us?

!(image of concerns postcard)[/images/TopConcerns01.png]

The sustainability and Environmental Education group carried out a a survey of, among other things, young people's attitudes towards envirnomental issues, identifying and then ranking the importance of the top issues for them. These same issues were then ranked by adults (a limited sample, those adults associated with the SEEd workshops and events). What is interesting is that young people identify and prioritised the hot issues as problems, while the adults prioritised the areas of civic life likely to address these. Is this because young people are simpley ware of and angry about the issues first and foremost, or becasue they are less aware of the kinds of root causes and likely sources of action and remediation?
There is not enough data to answer this, but the difference in prioirties is worthy of note.
 - Adults prioritised *Humans existance and ignorance* and *Changing Business Operations* (*Plastics and Single Use Items* coming in third).
 - Children prioritised the results of our environemntal behaviours - *Pollution and Littering, Animal Extenction, and Deforesetartion*
Being aware of the biggest dowbstream problems is a great motivator for action, but tackling root causes and bahviours, and obstacles to those is the only way to start to shift the environmental and climate crises.
