# Tactile Data

First, I tried to represent the used earths with holes. This is interesting but perhaps not as impactful as it could be because it is still heavily relying on visual thinking. I want to start to explore tangible, tactile data as a way taking data from a way of understanding to a form of embodied knowing. It should feel second nature to interact with data and understand the key message.

In this postcard the viewer can physically feel the data as represented by matches. This brings the data off of the page and makes it tangible. I also tried to incoporate my new understanding of pataina wich is something beyond visual and almost a textual undertanding of history. It helped that I made lots of unsucessful creative marks that needed genuinely convering up to build up this texture.
