# Tactile Data #1

First, I tried to represent the used earths with holes. This is interesting but perhaps not as impactful as it could be because it is still heavily relying on visual thinking. I want to start to explore tangible, tactile data as a way of understanding to a form of embodied knowing. It should feel second nature to interact with data and understand the key message.

In this postcard the viewer can physically feel the data as represented by matches. This brings the data off of the page and makes it tangible. I also tried to incorporate my new understanding of patina which is something beyond visual and almost a textual understanding of history. It helped that I made lots of unsuccessful creative marks that needed genuinely covering up to build up this texture.
