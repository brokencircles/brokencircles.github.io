# Living Circular #1

Inspired by Fluxus happenings, I wanted to create an interactive postcard with activities for the audience to perform. This is where the art (or non-art) happens. Fluxus very much went against the grain of both established art and western cultural norms. This is similar to the change we want to encourage in consumer behaviour around circular actions. We know that at the core of this is encouraging new value systems, behaviours and finding opportunities in everyday life for the magic to happen.

###Completing the action challenges this week:
1. Over some mulled Cornish cider, a friend and I sat outside and reparied a broken musical instrument. Given the lack of pubs open at the moment, it was a rare and unique social occasion.
2. We also turned some old scaffolding planks into a very useful characterful table top and I learnt the definition of the word "patina" in relation to wood that had had a previous life and motorcycles. Working outside in nature in winter hfelt good, only once wearing gloves.
3. Services can be better for the environment than physical products but that it is not always the case. We should not assume this to be true without research. My dematerialisation this week is that I borrowed several handtools rather than purchased them to do some repair work. This had the additional positive unexpected effect of creating the conditions for steps 1 & 2 to occur. Hand tools are a good example of something that many people could share.
4. Rarely do we celebrate a non-action such as non-buying. I guess I could use the handtools as an example here too, but I don't think that would cut it for 'creative' so the example I will give is of creating space to do crafts, I transformed our small utility area into a space for glass painting, flower arranging, mosaic cutting, card making and more.  
5. I brought the typewriter back inside from my garage because (as you can see on the postcard) I noticed things begin to rust very quickly out there. I left the typewriter pre-step two for a week and rust had even printed onto the postcard (giving it a nice patina).
