# Snail Mail

I am still struggling with taking on and synthesising so much new information, and attempting to find paths to make sense and consolidate it.
At the other end, I am trying out different ideas and designs for citizen centred thinking around what we buy and why, and confronting the obstacles to changes in behaviours in the form of habits, and emotions. Linear product design and behaviours, and marketing to convince us that we need these things are deeply embedded. They have been hitting us where we buy for decades.
In the middle we still have lots of practical aspects of running this project. It is still early days, and some path will emerge from all of this.

Jon and I are spending lots of time on video to each other, and on the whole it is working, but along with other online commitments and meetings, it can be very tiring.
Last week, inspired by the [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject) project, we decided to use snail-mailed postcards as our own vehicle for sharing ideas we develop. We aim to send one a week, based on research or ideas we have come across, digested or developed. The first  one was last week. Now to keep it up.
