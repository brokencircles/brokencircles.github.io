#Embodied Impacts

Last week's data postcard to Jon explored the cummulative impacts embodied in a product we buy and use.

The things we do, the things we buy and use embody the impacts of all the materials and processes that go into making them, selling them, and gettimng them to you. This includes all of the the extraction, biosphere destruction, energy, waste, and social imapcts of each raw material, each step of manufactusing, assembly, distribution, retail, and your use of it. You see a bottle of laundry detergent with a bright label and so many doses of a useful coctail of chemicals that do a job for you. Before you even start to use it, picking up that bottle sends a message of approval back through the supply chains that this is OK, signalling to do more of the same. We are made to feel responsible for the recycling of containers, for the product choices we make and the consequences of our uses. And so we are, but not in a way that absolves all the processes and design decisions that got us to the point where we make (what appears to be a quite limited) choice, and where most of the true impacts are hidden and not compensated for in the price.
We are here to show you what these hidden impacts and consequences are, to show you how to really use your consumer voice, and use your choice to send signals back. This is truly your responsibility, and an underused power to change the economy. But in the meantime, please recycle.
