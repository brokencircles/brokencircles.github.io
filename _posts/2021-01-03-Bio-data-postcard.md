# Bio Data Postcard #1

Continuing our data postcard series, I was inspired by a workshop from [Circular Home Lab](http://circularhomelab.com/) to create this weeks postcard out of a translucent biodegradable bioplastic. The data contained within is a sample of wild flora and fungi from a walk in winter 2020. The bio-postcard will be fine to place in the composting bin afterward.
