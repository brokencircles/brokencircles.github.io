# Change is Tough - Part 2 (Change starts with you)

It seems we behave the way we behave, driven by habit, conditioning, the rewards and trade-offs of modern life, sometimes just by a need to get by. We get the things we need, or believe we need, to get through another day. We know there is a problem with this, but there are always problems in thr world. 

The problems of finite resoruces, species loss, climate crisis, all feel diconnected from our actions (even if a small rational part of us knows it is all connected). The connection that exists is a complex machine, a composite of millions of causes and effects. I can accept that my choices are a part of this problem, and the combined effect of these across billions of people is the majority of the problem, it seems improbable that any alternative choice I make is going to have any benefit. It feels feeble. There is  also a nagging doubt, nutured by social norma, and the messaging from commerce, brands, retail, that my act is an irrational coice, and makes me a fool, a loser, a chump. My small sacrifice is vanity, and ineffective. 

So what is my incentive to interupt my own tendancies, to make analternative choice? Perhaps it is not a sacrifice in my mind, it is a bold, heroic act. A generous helping hand to a future me, or a distant other who are already experiencing the innevitable consequences of previous inaction. Maybe it's me making the future I want to see. It is stepping out of the illusions or current norms and influence and having clear eyes to make a true choice.

The next economy will be different, simply because the current one is finding hard edges, and broken assumptions. Givernments, central bansk, big global brands are satying this out loud. Change will ... 

We really do have choices, and not just the illusion of choice presented by the rows of marginally varied packages of similar products in supermarkets, or scrolling down an online store. Each choice to examine what we actually need and look at ways of meeting that need, send a signal, via the numbers and algorithms, to those that extract, make, bundle, sell and influence. Trust me, they are listening.

There is a kind of innevitability that we are all goingto have to change, but also a huge innertia to come. Inertia is easier to overcome in small bodies. Change soemthing today in your world, with yor body. Tell someone about it, and change soemthing else tomorrow.
