# Surplus bin sort algorithm

A manual sort through my waste (surplus) bin over xmas 2020 revealed that we are still a long way away from circular packaging. That was the theme of this weeks mixed-media postcard.

There were 5 main groups that identified in my non-recyclables:

- Plastic based composites
- Composites which incorporated foil
- Polyethylene
- Polystyrene
- Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)

All of these materials are going straight into the waste stream when more careful material choices could have been used instead.

I was pleased to see some examples of innovative materials this year too, such as a paper based foam like material to replace polystyrene. Perhaps this will become a new Christmas tradition, an anecdotal measurement of the state of the circular economy in the UK by sorting through my waste bin on Boxing Day. And it will be a fine tradition.
