# About The Call

Two funded micro art residencies - Social media take-over  

We are inviting artists to take over a social media account and use words, images, photography, moving image, physical works, sound, anything really, to explore the themes of the [Circular Economy](https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/explore/the-circular-economy-in-detail), citizen motivations and behaviours such as:
• Explaining what the circular economy means and why citizens should care
• Challenge attitudes to circular consumption
• Getting past habitual associations such as often meaningless product packaging
• Revealing the choice we have as citizens to make more circular choices
• Consequences of our consumption (near and far, now and future)
• ...or some other angle we haven’t thought about

We are keen to include diverse voices and different perspectives. We are open to challenging, curious, uncomfortable, complex, novel ways of using this limited medium to create a conversation and reach followers. This is not about your traditional social content - we want you to use it as a platform for expression, provocation, curiosity exploration and/or criticality.

We expect the work to take place between February and March 2021.
